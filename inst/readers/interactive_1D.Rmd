abstract: \noindent Here we illustrate how to use the R-package *shiny* (Chang et al., 2020) to make interactive (web-based) reaction-transport models in R. Among other things, the approach allows you to quickly explore how the model output changes as a function of the input parameters. We use the *one-dimensional* model describing the dynamics of oxygen ($O_2$) and biochemical oxygen demand ($BOD$) in an estuary as an example.

# Model implementation in R

We recommend to start from a *fully developed* (and debugged) model. Once the model is working, we can use it to create a shiny user interface around it.

In this example, we use the BOD model implemented in the template file ``RTM_1D``. This model is fully developed and working, because it is recommended as a starting point in the development of more complicated 1D reaction-transport models. Thus, we can copy and paste the code here with only one minor modification: we change the name of the default model parameters from ``pars`` to ``default.pars``.

```{r, eval = TRUE, cache = FALSE, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```

The web interface will contain sliders allowing us to change the values of some of the model parameters and see the effect on the model result. It is most instructive if we compare these altered model runs with the output of the default model run. We therefore run the model first with the default parameters. Note that in this example we are only interested in a steady-state solution of the model. Thus, we use ``steady.1D`` to calculate the model output.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# find default model solution
Default.out <- steady.1D(y = state.ini, parms = default.pars, func = BOD1D, 
                         names = SVnames, nspec = length(SVnames), dimens = N,
                         positive = TRUE, atol = 1e-10, rtol = 1e-10)
```

# The web interface part

The code for interactive applications consists of a graphical user interface (UI) and a server.

## The graphical user interface

We choose a main page with a side bar as the layout for this webpage (``pageWithSidebar``). 

* The header panel contains the title of the webpage.
* The side bar contains 
   - sliders that can be moved to change the value of model parameters (``sliderInput``). Note that each slider has a name that will be accessed in the server function. Here we choose the name of the parameter as the slider name.
   - a check box that, if checked, will cause the default run to be plotted together with the current model output; its name is *defaultRun* (``checkboxInput``).
   - a button that, when clicked, will reset the default parameter values; its name is *resetButton* (``actionButton``).
* The main panel contains the plot of the model run. Note that the name ``PlotBOD`` is used in the server function.

Note that because ``default.pars`` is a *vector*, we access the specific element value through the corresponding element name (i.e., using the ``["element_name"]`` syntax) when passing the value in the ``sliderInput`` function.

```{r, message=FALSE}
require(shiny)

UI.BOD <- shinyUI(pageWithSidebar(      # Define UI (user interface)

  # Application title
  headerPanel("The BOD model"),

  sidebarPanel(
   sliderInput(inputId="kDecay", 
               label = "kDecay: rate constant of reaction BOD + O2 -> ... [/d]",
               min = 0, max = 0.2, step = 0.01, value = default.pars["kDecay"]),
   sliderInput(inputId="kAeration", 
               label = "kAeration: rate constant of areation [/d]",
               min = 0, max = 0.2, step = 0.01, value = default.pars["kAeration"]),
   sliderInput(inputId="inputBOD", 
               label = "inputBOD: input BOD flux at upstream boundary [mol/m2/d]",
               min = 0, max = 20, step = 1, value = default.pars["inputBOD"]),
   sliderInput(inputId="O2up", 
               label = "O2up: O2 concentration at upstream boundary [mol/m3]", 
               min = 0, max = 0.3, step = 0.01, value = default.pars["O2up"]),

   actionButton (inputId="resetButton",
                 label="Reset Parameters"),
    
   checkboxInput(inputId="defaultRun",
                 label=strong("Add default run"), value=TRUE),
   br()   # HTML break - note: ends without ','
  ),

  mainPanel(
      plotOutput("PlotBOD"))
))
```

## The server

In the server, we write the code that is executed when a UI object (slider, button, check box, etc.) changes its status. In this implementation, 

* function ``observeEvent`` will be triggered when a user clicks the reset button;
* function ``reactive`` will be executed when any of the sliders has been changed;
* function ``renderPlot`` will put a figure on the main panel.

```{r}
Server.BOD <- shinyServer(function(input, output, session) {

  # -------------------
  # the 'reset' button
  # -------------------
  observeEvent(input$resetButton, {
    def.pars.list <- as.list(default.pars) # we must convert default.pars to a list!
    updateNumericInput(session, "kDecay",    value = def.pars.list$kDecay)
    updateNumericInput(session, "kAeration", value = def.pars.list$kAeration)
    updateNumericInput(session, "inputBOD",  value = def.pars.list$inputBOD)
    updateNumericInput(session, "O2up",      value = def.pars.list$O2up)
  })

  # Get the model parameters, as defined in the UI.
  getpars <- reactive( {
    pars           <- as.list(default.pars)
    pars$kDecay    <- input$kDecay      # input is a LIST!!
    pars$kAeration <- input$kAeration
    pars$inputBOD  <- input$inputBOD
    pars$O2up      <- input$O2up
    return(unlist(pars))                # convert output to a VECTOR
  })

  # -------------------
  # the 'Plot' tab
  # -------------------
  output$PlotBOD <- renderPlot({     # will be visible in the main panel

    pars <- getpars() # Get model parameters, as defined in the UI

    out  <- steady.1D(y = state.ini, parms = pars, func = BOD1D, 
                          names = SVnames, nspec = length(SVnames), dimens = N,
                          positive = TRUE, atol = 1e-10, rtol = 1e-10)
   
    # define, which quantities should be displayed in the plot
    disp_quantities <- c("O2", "BOD", "Decay", "Aeration")
   
    if (input$defaultRun) {  # the check box is true
       plot (out, Default.out, lwd = 2, las = 1, lty = 1,
             cex.main = 1.5, cex.axis = 1.25, cex.lab = 1.25,
             which = disp_quantities, mfrow=c(2,3))
       plot.new() # DO NOT DO THIS unless there is an empty space for another plot!!!
       legend("left", legend = c("current", "default"), 
              cex = 1.5, col = 1:2, lty = 1)
     } else  
       plot (out, lwd = 2, las = 1, lty = 1,
             cex.main = 1.5, cex.axis = 1.25, cex.lab = 1.25,
             which = disp_quantities, mfrow=c(2,3))
   })  # end ouput$plot

})     # end of the definition of shinyServer
```

### Beware of important details 

Here, we emphasize a few subtle but important details to be aware of when defining ``shinyServer``.

* In the ``updateNumericInput`` function, which is used within the ``observeEvent`` function, the value passed to the input parameter ``value`` must be an element of a **list**. If this were not the case, resetting to default parameter values would not work (this is true at least in the version 1.7.1 of shiny). Because our default parameters are stored in a **vector** (``default.pars``), we convert this vector into a list (``def.pars.list``) just before we use it. 

* Similarly, the variable ``input`` inside the ``reactive`` function is a **list**. Therefore, we first convert the vector of our model parameters to a list (called ``pars``), then update the values based on the ``input`` (using the ``$`` syntax), and finally output the result as a vector (using ``unlist(par)``). 

Note that we would *not* need to consider these issues if the model parameters were defined as a *list* from the start (i.e., by defining ``default.pars <- list(...)`` rather than ``default.pars <- c(...)``). However, we do not want to break this habit here and thus continue using model parameters as a *vector*.

Another issue is the legend. Typically, we use ``plot.new()`` just after we plot the model results and just before we display the legend. Here, we rely on the fact that the implementation of the ``plot`` function in the ``deSolve`` package sets the arrangement (``mfrow``) of the plots optimally. For example, if the model output contains 5 variables, the default plot arrangement will be ``mfrow=c(2,3)``. In this case, there will be an *empty space* for a new plot, and it is this empty space where a legend will be placed by the function ``legend``. That is, everything will work as expected. However, if the model output only contained, for example, 4 variables, the default plot arrangement would be ``mfrow=c(2,2)``, implying that there would be *no* empty space within the default plot arrangement for a new plot. In this case, issuing the command ``plot.new()`` would *delete* the graphs plotted by the previous ``plot`` command, and only the plot with the legend would remain. To overcome this undesirable behavior, we *force* the ``mfrow`` value in the ``plot`` function to a value that leaves that required empty space for the legend. Specifically, we set ``mfrow=c(2,3)`` although we only want to plot 4 output variables.

# Run the web application

To run the model as a shiny app (see screenshot in Figure 1), first run the entire R-code above (e.g., in R-studio, choose Run $\rightarrow$ Run All) and then enter the following command in the R-console:

```{}
shinyApp(ui = UI.BOD, server = Server.BOD)
```

Alternatively, set R's working directory to the directory containing the Rmd file and run the following commands:

```{}
knitr::purl("interactive_1D.Rmd")    # to convert the R markdown file into an R-script
source("interactive_1D.R")           # to run the generated R-script
shinyApp(ui = UI.BOD, server = Server.BOD)  # to run the shiny app
```

You can leave the application by pressing ESC within the console.
