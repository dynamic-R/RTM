Once you start working on one code or program with several people, it becomes worthwhile to invest some time into the tools that are available for sharing, editing and tracking changes in such codes. Here we illustrate -briefly- how to work with Git, Gitlab and how this can be done from within Rstudio.

With any version control system such as git (or sourceforge, Rforge), open source code can be edited by different people, a history of the changes is kept, and changes can be accepted or rejected. 

It is often also possible to create team pages where the code of different projects can be put, webpages can be made that get a DOI and can be shared with published papers, and so on.

# Getting started with Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system.  To start sharing code, you need to install git on your computer, and choose a version control system manager such as e.g. GitLab or GitHub.

After you have created a test project, you can import it (checkout) from within Rstudio.

# 1. Create a gitlab account and install git on your computer 

***1.1 Install git *** 

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git 

**In MS Windows** Don't forget to untick the ‘Git Credential Manager’ checkbox during the Git for Windows installer (otherwise, see below).

See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37182847/how-to-disable-git-credential-manager-for-windows

***1.2 GitLab account *** 

Follow the steps on https://gitlab.com/

You will need to create an ssh key. How to do this is well explained in:

https://dev.to/sndrx/how-to-set-up-an-ssh-key-and-use-it-in-gitlab--42p1

# 2. Make a project (if you are the project master) - or link to the project (developer).

One of you (the *project master*) now should make a new project, and add all colleagues working on the same project as *developers*. 

The others (developers) then have to link to the project created by the project master.

If you ar the project master, within gitlab, you click "New Project" and give a name to the project. 

You are now the project master and can add new developers to the project.

    Goto settings (bottom left column)
    Click "Members"

Add the colleagues with whom you are working on the project.

Note that, before you can actually work on this project, you will need to add the project on your computer.

# 3. Check out your repository from within RStudio

##  You have developer access

To start working on an existing remote project on which you are granted to work as developer:
  
  In RStudio
    
    File / New Project / Version Control / Git
    
  Repository URL: https://gitlab.com/[user]/[Project]
    
  Working directory: Do not choose a directory where you already have files you are working on. Move these first to a temporary location.
  
You now have a local copy of the remote repository. 

### You do not have developer access

If you want to make a personal copy of an existing project on which you don't have developer access, you have to *fork* it first to your own account, and start working from there. 

Within gitlab, you go to the repository, and click *fork*.

You can now go back to your own account, find the URL of this project and proceed like above.

## 4. Normal workflow in RStudio

Once you've set up an project to use git (see 2.) you will find a number of new buttons 'commit', 'push' and 'pull' in the "git" tab at the topright in RStudio. 

In RStudio, the normal git workflow goes like this

- work on your local files in RStudio as you would normally do without git
- regularly 'commit' the changes, so that git 'locally' starts to track changes
- 'push' the changes as much as you want (after committing). Now your changes are also on-line, and viewable by other developers
- 'pull' the changes from the remote if other developers have changed some things.

If you made changes you believe should be kept, create a merge request: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/forking_workflow.html

This is the basics. Check  https://about.gitlab.com/2014/09/29/gitlab-flow/ for more advanced workflows.

## 5. Some common git commands ##

    git clone https://gitlab.com/[user]/[project]
Copies all information from the remote repository to your local machine

    git branch 
Shows all branches in the local repository

    git branch -a 
Shows all local and remote branches

    git checkout -b [branchname]

creates lokal branch tracking remote branch with same name name
all commits will be done to this branch, all pushes will be done to remote branch with the same name

    git status
Check which files in the local folder are tracked by git (locally)

# A short summary of steps

## Project development in Rstudio using a repository on GITHUB

The following steps are explained for Rstudio.

### Link a remote repository on Github.com to a local project

* File -> New project -> Version Control -> Git 
* type in Repository URL and project directory name
* specify the project folder

These step should enable a Git tab in the top-right corner of Rstudio.

* With the blue down-arrow, PULL the files from Github to the local computer.

### Create a new branch

Best way to start the development from an existing code is to create a new branch of the 'main' (or 'master') branch:

* SELECT the 'main' branch using the pull-down menu in the Git tab
* CREATE a new BRANCH by clicking the icon next to it (2 connected rectangles)
* once the branch is created, SELECT it in the Git tab and work from there.

Ensure that you only modify files in the newly created branch. Specifically, do not change branches and edit files there. You will avoid headaches later.

### Push files from your local branch to the remote branch

* click COMMIT in the Git tab
* spicify a commit message
* check a checkbox to specify which file should be changed
* click commit
* review the popup window to see that everything went smoothly, and close it

* click PUSH (green up-arrow)
* review the message to see that everything went smoothly

### Merge a branch to the main branch

Once you are satisfied with the code in the new branch, MERGE it with the main.

* select the main branch in the Git tab
* open terminal in Rstudio and type there the following command (we assume here that new_branch is the name of the new branch that you want to merge):
```
git merge new_branch
```
* PUSH changes to Github

### Delete a branch
After merging, you don't want to work on the new branch anymore. So you can just as well DELETE it.

* open terminal in Rstudio and type there the following command (we assume here that new_branch is the name of the new branch that you want to delete):

```
git branch -d new_branch
```
or
```
git branch -D new_branch
```
Then clean it up on the github repository:

```
git remote prune -n origin
git remote prune origin
```

## Other stuff

### Install the RTM package from the edited source developed via Github
In terminal, type
```
R CMD INSTALL RTM
```

### Configure authentication for Github
In terminal, type
```
git config --global user.name "your_user_name"
git config --global user.email "your_email_address"
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email_address"
ssh -T git@github.com
```

To cache your Github authentication, so that you don't need to enter a password every time you want to push updates to the Github, type in the terminal:

```
git config --global credential.helper cache
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=7200'
```

In this particular case, the password will need to be entered once at the beginning, and will "last" for 2 hrs (7200 s).
