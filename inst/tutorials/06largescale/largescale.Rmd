## Two-box model

Figure below shows a conceptual diagram of a two-reservoir system in a **steady state**, where carbon (C) flows between the reservoirs A and B. The carbon fluxes are described by **first-order kinetics** with respect to the C content in the source reservoir The corresponding values of X, Y and Z are X = 500 Pg C, Y = 2500 Pg C, and Z = 50  Pg C yr$^{-1}$.

![](images/TwoBox.png){width=12cm}

The R chunk below sets the values of these variables/parameters.

```{r rab-setup}
X <- 500   # Pg C
Y <- 2500  # Pg C
Z <- 50    # Pg C yr-1
```

```{r}
X <- 500
Y <- 2500
Z <- 50
```

Use R to estimate the rate constants $r_{AB}$ and $r_{BA}$ using the values of X, Y and Z given above.

```{r rab, exercise=TRUE}
# fill in the formulas
rAB <- 
print(rAB)
rBA <- 
print(rBA)
```

<div id="rab-hint">
**Hint:** The equations to use are depicted in the figure above.
</div>

```{r rab-solution1, echo=FALSE}
msg <- sprintf("The rate constant $r_{AB}$ relates to the total flux $F_{AB}$ as : $r_{AB}=F_{AB}/A$; the steady-state value of $F_{AB}$ and $A$ are given by $Z=50$ and $X=500$ respectively, so the answer is: $r_{AB}= Z/X$")

question("What is the value of the rate constant $r_{AB}$? (Note: 'dot' is used as a decimal separator)", type = "learnr_radio",
 answer(sprintf("%.2f $yr^{-1}$", Z/Y)),
 answer(sprintf("%.1f $yr^{-1}$", X/Z)),
 answer(sprintf("%.2f $yr^{-1}$", Z/X), correct=TRUE),
 incorrect = msg,   
 correct = msg
)
```

```{r rba-solution1, echo=FALSE}
question("What is the value of the rate constant $r_{BA}$?", type = "learnr_radio",
 answer(sprintf("%.2f $yr^{-1}$", Z/Y), correct=TRUE),
 answer(sprintf("%.1f $yr^{-1}$", X/Z)),
 answer(sprintf("%.2f $yr^{-1}$", X/Y))
)
```

## Residence time

**Residence time** is defined as the amount of material in the reservoir divided by the total rate of outflow of the material. 

Thus, for carbon in the reservoirs $A$ and $B$, the corresponding residence times are calculated according to $$\tau_A = \frac{A}{F_{AB}}$$ 
$$\tau_B = \frac{B}{F_{BA}}$$
Because in our case the rates of outflow are proportional to the size of the source reservoir, i.e., $F_{AB} = r_{AB}\cdot A$ and $F_{BA} = r_{BA} \cdot B$, we have

$$ \tau_A = \frac{A}{r_{AB}\cdot A} = \frac{1}{r_{AB}} $$
$$ \tau_B = \frac{B}{r_{BA}\cdot B} = \frac{1}{r_{BA}} $$
That is, residence times are equal to the *inverse* of the rate constants describing the outflow.

Use R to estimate the **residence time** of carbon in the reservoirs $A$ and $B$. Use the same values of X, Y and Z as before.

```{r tab-setup}
X <- 500
Y <- 2500
Z <- 50
```

```{r tab, exercise=TRUE}
# fill in the formulas
tA <- 
print(tA)
tB <- 
print(tB)
```

```{r ta-solution, echo=FALSE}
question("What is the residence time of carbon in the reservoir $A$, $\\tau_{A}$? (Note: 'dot' is used as a decimal separator)",
         type = "learnr_radio",
 answer(sprintf("%.2f $yr$", X/Y)),
 answer(sprintf("%.1f $yr$", X/Z), correct=TRUE),
 answer(sprintf("%.2f $yr$", Z/X))
)
```

```{r tb-solution, echo=FALSE}
question("What is the residence time of carbon in the reservoir $B$, $\\tau_{B}$?", type = "learnr_radio",
 answer(sprintf("%.2f $yr$", Y/Z), correct=TRUE),
 answer(sprintf("%.1f $yr$", Z/X)),
 answer(sprintf("%.2f $yr$", Z/Y))
)
```

## Equilibrium

![](images/TwoBox.png){width=12cm}

For a system comprising reservoirs $A$ and $B$ (see figure above), the mass balances are expressed by the following set of *coupled* differential equations:

$$\frac{dA}{dt} = -r_{AB}\cdot A + r_{BA}\cdot B$$
$$\frac{dB}{dt} = r_{AB}\cdot A - r_{BA}\cdot B$$

By summing these two equations, we obtain
$$\frac{d(A+B)}{dt} = 0 $$
This last differential equation represents the **conservation** of carbon in the system. Specifically, because the system is closed, the *total* amount of carbon in the system does *not* change over time and is equal to the initial value:
$$ A(t) + B(t) = A_{ini}+B_{ini}\qquad\qquad [1]$$
where $A_{ini}$ and $B_{ini}$ denote the corresponding initial values of $A$ and $B$.

**Equilibrium** (or **steady state**) is defined as a state of a system where state variables do *not* vary over time, i.e., all time-derivatives are equal to zero. 

By setting $dA/dt = 0$ and $dB/dt=0$, the above set of differential equations is transformed to a set of algebraic equations:

$$0 = -r_{AB}\cdot A_{eq} + r_{BA}\cdot B_{eq}$$
$$0 = r_{AB}\cdot A_{eq} - r_{BA}\cdot B_{eq}$$
where $A_{eq}$ and $B_{eq}$ denote the size of the reservoirs $A$ and $B$ in equilibrium. 

Note that these two equations are identical and provide the following relationship between the equilibrium values:

$$r_{AB}\cdot A_{eq} = r_{BA}\cdot B_{eq}\qquad\qquad [2]$$

The equilibrium values $A_{eq}$ and $B_{eq}$ can relatively easily be calculated. Specifically, because equation [1] is valid at any time point $t$, it is also valid when the system is in equilibrium. Thus, we have 
$$A_{eq}+B_{eq} = A_{ini} + B_{ini}\qquad\qquad [3]$$
By solving for $B_{eq}$ in Eq. [2] and substituting the result to Eq. [3], we obtain
$$ A_{eq} = \frac{r_{BA}}{r_{AB}+r_{BA}}\cdot (A_{ini} + B_{ini}) \qquad\qquad [4a]$$
Similarly, by solving for $A_{eq}$ in Eq. [2] and substituting the result to Eq. [3], we obtain
$$ B_{eq} = \frac{r_{AB}}{r_{AB}+r_{BA}}\cdot (A_{ini} + B_{ini}) \qquad\qquad [4b]$$

Assume that the system comprising reservoirs $A$ and $B$ has been **perturbed** from the steady state by adding $100~Pg~C$ from an *external* source to the reservoir $A$, while the reservoir $B$ remained unchanged. This perturbation did not affect the rate laws nor the rate constants. After some time, the system returned to a new steady state (new equilibrium). Before the perturbation, the amounts of carbon in reservoirs $A$ and $B$ were equal to $X$ and $Y$, respectively.

Use R to estimate the new **equilibrium** values $A_{eq}$ and $B_{eq}$. As before, use the following values of X, Y and Z.

```{r eq-setup}
X <- 500
Y <- 2500
Z <- 50
```

```{r eq, exercise=TRUE}
A.eq    <-     # enter formula
B.eq    <-     # enter formula
c(A.eq=A.eq, B.eq=B.eq)
```

```{r eq-solution1, echo=FALSE}
msg <- "$A_{eq}$ is calculated using equation [4a] and considering that the initial carbon content in the perturbed system is $A_{ini}+B_{ini}=X+Y+100$."

question("What is the value of the equilibrium carbon content in reservoir A?", type = "learnr_radio",
 answer(sprintf("%.3f $Pg~C$", Y/(X+Y)*(X+Y+100))),
 answer(sprintf("%.3f $Pg~C$", X/(X+Y)*(X+Y+100)), correct=TRUE),
 answer(sprintf("%.2f $Pg~C$", X/(X+Y)*(X+Y+80))),
 
 incorrect = paste("Incorrect.", msg),
 correct = paste("Correct.", msg) 
)
```

```{r eq-solution2, echo=FALSE}
msg <- "$B_{eq}$ is calculated using equation [4b] and considering that the initial carbon content in the perturbed system is $A_{ini}+B_{ini}=X+Y+100$."

question("What is the value of the equilibrium carbon content in reservoir B?", type = "learnr_radio",
 answer(sprintf("%.3f $Pg~C$", Y/(X+Y)*(X+Y+100)), correct=TRUE),
 answer(sprintf("%.3f $Pg~C$", X/(X+Y)*(X+Y+100))),
 answer(sprintf("%.2f $Pg~C$", Y/(X+Y)*(X+Y+80))),
 
 incorrect = paste("Incorrect.", msg),
 correct = paste("Correct.", msg)
         )
```

## Implementation in R

Based on the reader that has introduced you to solving dynamic models in R (see Sec. 8 in the reader), it should be relatively easy for you to understand the following R-code. The code allows you to predict the dynamics of carbon in reservoirs $A$ and $B$ under various scenarios. 

Modify this R-code to implement two types of perturbation of the system: 

* **Deforestation**, which is modeled by assuming that $100~Pg~C$ was instantaneously moved from the reservoir $B$ (biosphere) to the reservoir $A$ (atmosphere).

* **Burning of fossil fuels**, which is modeled by assuming that $100~Pg~C$ was instantaneously added to the reservoir $A$ (atmosphere) from an external reservoir (fossil fuels) that is not part of the model, whereas the initial size of $B$ remained unchanged.

Verify that after some time, the system reaches a steady state, and that the steady state values $A_{eq}$ and $B_{eq}$ agree with those calculated earlier in this tutorial. 

```{r model2box-setup}
X <- 500
Y <- 2500
Z <- 50
```

```{r model2box, exercise=TRUE, echo=FALSE, exercise.lines = 23}
require(deSolve)

model2box <- function(t, s, p){  # model function
  with( as.list(c(s, p)), {
    dA.dt <- -rAB*A + rBA*B
    dB.dt <-  rAB*A - rBA*B
    return(list(c(dA.dt, dB.dt), SUM = A + B))
  })
}
pars <- c(rAB = Z/X, rBA = Z/Y)  # model parameters

# initial states
state.ini1 <- c(A = X, B = Y)         # steady state
state.ini2 <- c(A = X-10, B = Y+10)   # perturbed

t.seq <- seq(from=0, to=100, by=1)    # time sequence

# calculate the solutions
out1 <- ode(y=state.ini1, time=t.seq, func=model2box, parms=pars)
out2 <- ode(y=state.ini2, time=t.seq, func=model2box, parms=pars)

plot(out1, out2, lwd=2, mfrow=c(1,3))  # plot solutions
tail(out2, n=3) # see the equilibrium values
```

## More exercises

If you finished this tutorial but some of your answers were incorrect, you are encouraged to do the quiz again. You can do this by clicking on <span style="color:red">**Start Over**</span> at the bottom of the menu to the left.

To apply the knowledge you gained so far, expand the 2-box model from this tutorial towards a more complicated system: the Earth's global carbon cycle comprising 7 reservoirs.

Enter the following commands in the R console to get the full description of this exercise.

```
require(RTM)
RTMexercise("carbonCycle")
```

### Extra challenging

The global carbon cycle model is a wonderful example of models that study the response of perturbed systems. If you are curious and would like to learn more about perturbed systems, and specifically about a method that allows you to find the characteristic time scales of their response, you can do so by studying the following readers. Note that the topics covered in these readers are extra challenging and require somewhat advanced knowledge of calculus and algebra.
