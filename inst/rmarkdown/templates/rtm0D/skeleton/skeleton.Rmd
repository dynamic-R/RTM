# Introduction

This template file contains a simple box model describing the dynamics of molecular oxygen (O$_2$, in $mol~m^{-3}$) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD, in $mol~m^{-3}$) in a lake. It is assumed that 

* O$_2$ and BOD are removed due to BOD decay (O$_2$:BOD stoichiometry of 1:1),
* BOD decay is a first-order process with respect to BOD ($k_{Decay} = 0.05~d^{-1}$) and depends on O$_2$ according to the Michaelis-Menten kinetics ($K_{O2}=0.001~mol~m^{-3}$),
* O$_2$ is added by air-water exchange ($k_{Aeration}=0.1~d^{-1}$, $O_{2,sat} = 0.3~mol~m^{-3}$),
* BOD is added at a constant rate ($0.001~mol~m^{-3}~d^{-1}$),
* initial concentrations are $O_{2,ini}=0.25~mol~m^{-3}$ and $BOD_{ini} = 0.5~mol~m^{-3}$.

# Model definition

```{r, eval = TRUE, cache = FALSE, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# units: time=days, amount=moles, concentration=mol/m3

# Initial conditions of the state variables
state.ini <- c(O2 = 0.25, BOD = 0.5) # both in [mol/m3]

# Model parameters
pars <- c(
  kDecay     = 0.05 , # [/d]       first-order rate constant
  K.O2       = 0.001, # [mol/m3]   half-saturation O2 concentration
  satO2      = 0.3  , # [mol/m3]   O2 solubility
  kAeration  = 0.1  , # [/d]       reaeration rate constant
  inputBOD   = 0.001  # [mol/m3/d] constant BOD input rate
)

# Model function: calculates time-derivatives and other output
BODmodel <-function(t, state, parms) { 
  # t: time, state: state variables at time t, parms: model parameters
  with (as.list(c(state, parms)),{
 
    # rate expressions [mol/m3/d]
    Decay      <- kDecay * BOD * O2/(O2+K.O2) # BOD decay
    Aeration   <- kAeration * (satO2-O2)      # air-water exchange

    # Time-derivatives: dC/dt = production - consumption [mol/m3/d]
    dO2.dt      <- Aeration - Decay
    dBOD.dt     <- inputBOD - Decay

    # return time-derivatives and ordinary variables as a list     
    return(list(c(dO2.dt, dBOD.dt), # vector with derivatives 
                                    # (the same order as state variables!)
      # other output: process rates
      Decay    = Decay,
      Aeration = Aeration))    
  })
}
```

# Model solution

## Dynamic solution

We run the model dynamically over 100 days, using two different values of the reaeration rate constant: 

```{r, message=FALSE}
require(deSolve)  # package with integration methods

outtimes <- seq(from = 0, to = 100, length.out = 100) # vector of output times

# ode integrates the model
out <- ode(y = state.ini, parms = pars, func = BODmodel, times = outtimes)                

# change the value of the reaeration rate constant
pars2      <- pars                          # copy the original parameter vector
pars2["kAeration"] <- pars2["kAeration"]/10 # 10-fold lower kAeration

# integrate the model with the new parameters
out2 <- ode(y = state.ini, parms = pars2, func = BODmodel, times = outtimes)                
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# print summary of the solution
summary(out)
```

We plot both solutions in one graph:

```{r, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6, fig.align='center'}
plot(out, out2, xlab="time (days)", las=1, lwd=2,
     ylab=list("molO2/m3","molBOD/m3","molBOD/m3/d","molO2/m3/d"))
legend("topright", legend = c("original", "10-fold lower"),
       title="aeration rate constant:", 
       col=1:2, lwd=2, lty=1:2, bty="n")
```

## Steady-state solution

We find the steady-state solution:

```{r, message=FALSE}
require(rootSolve) # package with solution methods
std <- steady(y = state.ini, parms = pars, func = BODmodel, 
              positive = TRUE) # to ensure that the solution is positive
std$y
```

Sometimes, it may happen that there are *multiple* steady state solutions to a model (e.g., one with non-zero values, another one with zero values). In this case, the ``steady`` function is unable to "decide" which one to choose and stops with an error. To overcome this error, use the function ``runsteady`` instead to find the steady state solution.

```{r, message=FALSE}
std <- runsteady(y = state.ini, parms = pars, func = BODmodel)
std$y
```

## Sensitivity analysis

We perform a sensitivity analysis to find how the steady-state depends on the reaeration rate constant:

```{r}
k.seq   <- seq(from = 0.01, to = 0.1, length.out = 100)
BOD.seq <- vector()  # will contain the results
O2.seq  <- vector()

for (i in 1:length(k.seq)){
  # parameter values for this run
  p <- pars
  p["kAeration"] <- k.seq[i]  # reaeration rate constant based on the sequence
  # steady-state with new parameter values
  std <- steady(y = state.ini, parms = p, func = BODmodel, positive = TRUE)  
  BOD.seq[i] <- std$y["BOD"]
  O2.seq[i]  <- std$y["O2"]
}
```

Finally, we plot the results of the sensitivity analysis:

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5}
par(mfrow=c(1,2)) # figures in 1 row, 2 columns
plot(k.seq, O2.seq,  type="l", xlab="kAeration [/d]", main="O2",  ylab="molO2/m3")
plot(k.seq, BOD.seq, type="l", xlab="kAeration [/d]", main="BOD", ylab="molBOD/m3")
```
