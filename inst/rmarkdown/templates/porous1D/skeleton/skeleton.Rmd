# Introduction

This template contains an R implementation of a simple one-dimensional reaction-transport model in a porous medium. You are free to use and expand it based on your needs. Another template (+ text) provides a more detailed explanation of what this file does.

# R implementation

Load the required packages.

```{r, message = FALSE}
require(marelac)
require(ReacTran)
```

## The model grid and associated properties

Define the model grid and model parameters that vary in space.

```{r}
# spatial domain: total length of 20 cm, 200 boxes
Length    <- 0.20   # [m]
N         <- 200
# grid with equally sized boxes (not used here)
Grid      <- setup.grid.1D(L = Length, N = N)

# grid with an exponentially increasing grid size, starting from 0.05 cm (5e-4m)
Grid      <- setup.grid.1D(L = Length, N = N, dx.1 = 0.05/100)

# function describing the variation of porosity (volume fraction of LIQUID) with depth
porFun.L  <- function(x, por.SWI, por.deep, porcoef)
  return( por.deep + (por.SWI-por.deep)*exp(-x*porcoef) )

# function describing the SOLID volume fraction (svf = 1-porosity)
porFun.S  <- function(x, por.SWI, por.deep, porcoef)
  return( 1-porFun.L(x, por.SWI, por.deep, porcoef) )

# calculate porosity and svf on the grid (mid-points and box interfaces, etc.)
porLiquid <- setup.prop.1D(func=porFun.L, grid=Grid, por.SWI=0.9, por.deep=0.7, porcoef=100)
porSolid  <- setup.prop.1D(func=porFun.S, grid=Grid, por.SWI=0.9, por.deep=0.7, porcoef=100)

# Sediment diffusion coefficient for HCO3^- (m2/d), defined at box interfaces!! (N+1 values)
diff.DIC  <- diffcoeff(S=35, t=20)$HCO3 * 3600*24  # m2/s to m2/d
porInt    <- porLiquid$int                         # porosity at the box interfaces            
diffDIC   <- diff.DIC/(1-log(porInt^2))            # corrected for tortuosity
```

Visualise these settings:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=2.7}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(porLiquid, type="l", grid = Grid, xyswap = TRUE, ylab = "depth (m)", 
     main = "porosity", xlab = "m3_liquid / m3_bulk")
plot(porSolid,  type="l", grid = Grid, xyswap = TRUE, ylab = "depth (m)", 
     main = "svf = 1-porosity", xlab = "m3_solid / m3_bulk")
plot(diffDIC, y = Grid$x.int, type="l", ylim = c(Length,0), ylab = "depth (m)", 
     main = "sediment diff. coeff (DIC)", xlab = "m2/d")
```

## Additional model parameters

Define model parameters that do *not* vary in space.

```{r}
parms <- c(
 Dbio     = 5e-4/365,   # [m2/d]      bioturbation mixing coefficient
 v_adv    = 5e-6,       # [m/d]       sediment advection velocity   
 rMin     = 0.005,      # [/d]        POC mineralisation rate constant
 depoPOC  = 1e-3,       # [mol/m2/d]  POC deposition rate (flux at SWI)
 bwDIC    = 2           # [mol/m3]    DIC concentration at SWI
)
```

## Definition and initialisation of state variables

```{r}
names    <- c("POC", "DIC")
nspec    <- length(names)
POC.ini  <- rep(0, length = N)      # initial conditions 
DIC.ini  <- rep(0, length = N)
state    <- c(POC.ini, DIC.ini)
```

## Definition of the model function

Define the model function that calculates the *time-derivatives* for each state variable. This includes the implementation of the transport and reaction terms.

```{r}
Diamodel <- function (t, state, pars)   # state is a LONG vector
{
  with (as.list(pars),{ 
    
    # unpack state variables
    POC <- state[   1 :   N ]    # first N elements: POC
    DIC <- state[(N+1):(2*N)]    # next N elements:  DIC

    # === transport rates ===
    # note: zero gradient by default at lower boundaries
 
    # solid substances, VF = solid volume fraction = 1-porosity!    
    tran.POC <- tran.1D(C = POC, flux.up = depoPOC,  # upper boundary: flux 
                        dx = Grid, VF = porSolid,    # grid and volume fraction (1-por)
                        D = Dbio, v = v_adv)         # mixing (bioturbation) and advection

    # dissolved substances, VF = liquid volume fraction = porosity!
    tran.DIC <- tran.1D(C = DIC, C.up = bwDIC,       # upper boundary: concentration
                        dx = Grid, VF = porLiquid,   # grid and volume fraction (por)
                        D = diffDIC, v = v_adv)      # diffusive mixing and advection
                                                     # (bioturbation mixing negligible)
 
    # === reaction rates ===
    # POC mineralisation
    Mineralisation <- rMin * POC   # [mol/m3 SOLID/d] (per volume of solid!)

    # more rate expressions can be added here ...
    
    # === mass balances : dC/dt = transport + reactions ===
    
    # solid substances
    dPOC.dt   <- ( tran.POC$dC                       # transport
                 - Mineralisation )                  # reactions, [mol/m3 SOLID/d] !!
    
    # dissolved substances
    poro      <- porLiquid$mid
    dDIC.dt   <- ( tran.DIC$dC +                     # transport
                   Mineralisation * (1-poro)/poro )  # reactions, [mol/m3 LIQUID/d] !!

    # depth-integrated rates: [mol/m2 BULK/d] !!
    TotalMin  <- sum(Mineralisation*Grid$dx*porSolid$mid)
  
    return(list(c(dPOC.dt, dDIC.dt),            # the time-derivatives, as a long vector
          Mineralisation = Mineralisation,      # Mineralisation rates, as a vector
             
          # for creating budgets
          TotalMin      = TotalMin,             # [mol/m2 BULK/d]
          DIC.SWI.Flux  = tran.DIC$flux.up,     # [mol/m2 BULK/d]
          DIC.Deep.Flux = tran.DIC$flux.down,   # [mol/m2 BULK/d]
          POC.SWI.Flux  = tran.POC$flux.up,     # [mol/m2 BULK/d]
          POC.Deep.Flux = tran.POC$flux.down))  # [mol/m2 BULK/d]
 })
}
```

## Steady-state solution

Find a steady-state solution with the function *steady.1D* from the package *rootSolve*.

```{r}
p0 <- p1 <- p2 <- parms      # three runs with different deposition rates

p0["depoPOC"]  <- 0          # mol/m2/day
std0 <- steady.1D (y=state, func=Diamodel, parms=p0, 
                   nspec=nspec, dimens=N, names=names,
                   positive = TRUE)     # to have only positive values! 

p1["depoPOC"]  <- 1e-3       # mol/m2/day
std1 <- steady.1D (y=state, func=Diamodel, parms=p1, 
                   nspec=nspec, dimens=N, names=names,
                   positive = TRUE)     

p2["depoPOC"]  <- 2e-3       # mol/m2/day
std2 <- steady.1D (y=state, func=Diamodel, parms=p2, 
                   nspec=nspec, dimens=N, names=names,
                   positive = TRUE) 
```

### Plotting

Visualize the steady state solutions, including the depth profile of the process rate.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
plot(std0, std1, std2, xyswap=TRUE, grid=Grid$x.mid, lty=1, lwd=2,
     which = c("POC",            "DIC",             "Mineralisation"  ),
     xlab  = c("molC/m3 Solid", "molC/m3 Liquid", "molC/m3 Solid/d"), 
     ylab  = "depth (m)", mfrow=c(1,3))

legend("bottomright", legend=c("0", "1e-3", "2e-3"), title="mol/m2/d", 
       lwd=2, lty=1, col=1:3)
```

### Budget

Check the fluxes at the domain boundaries (only done for the steady-state solution *std1*).

```{r}
toselect <- c("TotalMin", "DIC.SWI.Flux", "DIC.Deep.Flux", "POC.SWI.Flux", "POC.Deep.Flux")
BUDGET   <- std1[toselect]
unlist(BUDGET)    # show result
```

Construct the total C budget in the modeled spatial domain to verify that the mass balances are correct.

```{r}
# should be the same:
# net POC rate is negative => POC is net removed within the domain
c(BUDGET$POC.Deep.Flux - BUDGET$POC.SWI.Flux, -BUDGET$TotalMin)
# net DIC rate is positive => DIC is net produced within the domain
c(BUDGET$DIC.Deep.Flux - BUDGET$DIC.SWI.Flux,  BUDGET$TotalMin)
```

## Dynamic solution

Find the dynamic solution using the function *ode.1D* from the package *deSolve*. The steady-state solution *std1* is used as the initial condition. 

```{r}
times          <- seq(from = 0, to = 2*365, by = 10)
p2             <- parms
p2["depoPOC"]  <- parms["depoPOC"]*10         # mol/m2/day
out            <- ode.1D(y=std1$y, func=Diamodel, parms=p2, times = times,
                         nspec=nspec, dimens=N, names=names )
```

### Plotting

Visualise the dynamic solution as an image.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
par(mar = c(4,4,4,4))
image(out, legend = TRUE, grid = Grid$x.mid, ylim = c(Length,0), 
      las = 1, ylab = "depth (m)", xlab="time (d)")
```

Output as lines showing the depth distribution for all time points.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
matplot.1D(out, type = "l", grid = Grid$x.mid, 
      col = grey(seq(0.2,0.8,len=length(times))), # This will use a sequence of greyish colors
                                                  # grey(1) = white, grey(0) = black
      las = 1, xyswap = TRUE, lty = 1, ylab="depth (m)",
      xlab = c("mol/m3 SOLID", "mol/m3 LIQUID"))
```

Visualise the fluxes at the SWI and in the deep sediment as a function of time.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=3}
plot(out, which = c("DIC.SWI.Flux", "DIC.Deep.Flux", "POC.SWI.Flux", "POC.Deep.Flux"), 
     mfrow=c(1,4), xlab="time (d)", ylab="mol/m2/d")
```
