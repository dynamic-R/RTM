# Introduction

This template file contains a simple model that assumes a local chemical equilibrium. Specifically, species A, B and AB are assumed to react according to the following fast reversible reaction

$$AB \leftrightarrow A + B.$$

Additionally, species A is assumed to be removed from the system by a slow irreversible process.

The model is rewritten in terms of lump sum species $B_{tot} = [AB] + [B]$ and $A_{tot} = [AB] + [A]$. For more information on the model, see the reader "Local Equilibrium Chemistry in R --- part I: One Equilibrium Reaction". This reader can be viewed using the R-command ``RTMexercise("equilibriumNH3")``.

# Model definition

```{r, eval = TRUE, cache = FALSE, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(deSolve)  # package with solution methods

# Initial conditions of the state variables
Atot.ini <- 0.070  # [mol/m3] Initial concentration of total A (i.e., A+AB)
Btot.ini <- 0.060  # [mol/m3] Initial concentration of total B (i.e., B+AB)

state.ini <- c(Atot = Atot.ini, Btot = Btot.ini)

# model parameters
pars  <- c (kf     = 1000, # [/s]     forward rate constant
            kb     = 2e6,  # [/mol m3 /s] backward rate constant
            lambda = 0.1   # [/s]     rate constant for the slow first-order removal of A
                            # note that lambda << kf and lambda << kb*Btot
                            # (i.e., the local equilibrium assumption is valid)
)
```

A function to numerically solve for the concentration of species $B$ based on the concentration of species $A_{tot}$ and $B_{tot}$ (assuming local equilibrium).

```{r}
solveB <- function(Keq, Atot, Btot){
  
  # function whose root has to be sought (eq. 10 in the reader)
  rootFun <- function(B) {
    return( B + B/(Keq+B)*Atot - Btot )
  }
  
  # uniroot will find the root; it returns a list with $root being the solution
  r <- uniroot(f = rootFun, lower = 0, upper = Btot, tol = 1e-20)
  return( r$root )
}
```

The model function calculates the time derivatives determined by the differential equations.

```{r}
EqModel_num <- function(t, state, parms) {
  with (as.list(c(state, parms)), {
    
    Keq  <- kf/kb
    
    # calculate B from Atot and Btot numerically, using solveB
    B    <- solveB(Keq = Keq, Atot = Atot, Btot = Btot) 
    # calculate A from Atot and B (eq. 7 in the reader) 
    A    <- Keq /(Keq+B)*Atot
    
    # mass balance equations for Atot and Btot 
    # under the local equilibrium condition, only the slow removal processes affect
    # the lump sum species Atot and Btot
    dAtot.dt <- -lambda * A 
    dBtot.dt <- 0
    
    return(list(c(dAtot.dt, dBtot.dt),
                B = B, A = A, AB = Atot-A, # individual species
                Q = A*B/(Atot-A) ))        # quotient, Q=Keq in equilibrium
  })
}
```

The model is run for 10 seconds.

```{r}
times <- seq(from=0, to=10, length.out=1000)
out   <- ode(y=state.ini, times=times, func=EqModel_num, parms=pars)
```

```{r}
plot(out, ylab="mol/m3")
```
