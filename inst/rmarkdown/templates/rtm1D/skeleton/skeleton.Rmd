# Introduction

This template file contains a simple one-dimensional reaction-transport model describing the dynamics of molecular oxygen ($O_2$, in $mol~m^{-3}$) and biochemical oxygen demand ($BOD$, in $mol~m^{-3}$) in an estuary that is in contact with air. 

The model domain is divided into a grid with $N$ equally sized boxes ($N=100$).

Both $BOD$ and $O_2$ are *vectors* with a length of $N$. They represent the concentrations of the state variables in the *center* of the boxes.

With regard to the reactions, a simple first-order decay of $BOD$ that is limited by $O_2$ is assumed. This process consumes both $BOD$ and $O_2$ with a stoichiometry of 1:1. $O_2$ is additionally exchanged with the atmosphere.

The species are modeled with the following boundary conditions:

* $BOD$: imposed flux upstream (*flux.up*), imposed concentration downstream (*C.down*).
* $O_2$: imposed concentration upstream (*C.up*), zero-gradient downstream (default, need not be specified).

The partial derivatives related to *transport* are approximated with function ``tran.1D()`` from the *ReacTran* package. The steady-state and dynamic solutions are obtained using functions from the *rootSolve* and *deSolve* packages, respectively. The latter two packages are loaded together with *ReacTran*.

# Model solution

## Dynamic solution

Model is solved over 100 days with the initial conditions specified above.

```{r}
outtimes <- seq(from = 1, to = 100, length.out = 100)   # output times

# ode.1D integrates the 1D model 
out <- ode.1D(y = yini, parms = pars, func = BOD1D, times = outtimes, 
              names = SVnames, nspec = length(SVnames), dimens = N)                
```

Display the solution as an image, time plot, and lines.

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
image(out, grid = Grid$x.mid, ylab = "distance (m)", legend = TRUE)
```

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
# each curve represents the solution at a given time point
matplot.1D(out, type = "l", lty = 1, 
           col = gray(seq(0.2,0.8,len=length(outtimes))),
           xlab = "distance (m)", ylab = "mol/m3")
```

```{r, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
# plot selected output variables
plot(out, which=c("MeanDecay", "MeanAeration", "O2influx", "BODinflux"), 
     mfrow=c(2,2),                  # graph arrangement (2x2)
     ylab=c("mol/m3/d","mol/m3/d","mol/m2/d","mol/m2/d"))
```

## Steady-state solution

Find a steady state solution to the model.

```{r}
# find steady state solution
std <- steady.1D(y = yini, parms = pars, func = BOD1D, 
          positive = TRUE,               # to ensure that the solution is positive
          names = SVnames, nspec = length(SVnames), dimens = N,
          atol = 1e-10, rtol = 1e-10)    # to increase the precision of the solution

names(std)          # std holds the state variables (y) and ordinary variables
head(std$y, n = 2)  # std$y contains the state variables (matrix)
```

A second run without aeration.

```{r}
p2 <- pars              # copy of parameter vector
p2["kAeration"] <- 0    # set reaeration rate constant to 0

std2 <- steady.1D(y = yini, parms = p2, func = BOD1D, 
          positive = TRUE,               # to ensure that the solution is positive
          names = SVnames, nspec = length(SVnames), dimens = N,
          atol = 1e-10, rtol = 1e-10)    # to increase the precision of the solution
```

Display results.

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
plot(std, std2, grid = Grid$x.mid,  # plot ONLY state variables (default)
     ylab = "mol/m3", xlab = "distance (m)")
```

```{r, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
plot(std, std2, grid = Grid$x.mid, 
     which=c("O2", "BOD",           # plot state variables 
             "Decay", "Aeration"),  # AND process rates
     mfrow=c(2,2),                  # graph arrangement (2x2)
     ylab =c("mol/m3","mol/m3","mol/m3/d", "mol/m3/d"), xlab = "distance (m)") 
```

## Budgetting of the steady-state model

```{r}
toselect <- c("TotalDecay", "TotalAeration", # select output for budgetting
              "O2influx",   "O2efflux",      # all values in mol/m2/d
              "BODinflux",  "BODefflux")
BUDGET <- std[toselect]
unlist(BUDGET)     # display BUDGET as a vector with named elements rather than a list
```

Check mass balances across the modeled domain: for each state variable, the *difference between fluxes* at the lower and upper boundaries should be **equal** to the *net production rate* integrated along the domain.

```{r}
# BOD mass balance check
c(flux_difference =  BUDGET$BODefflux - BUDGET$BODinflux, 
  integrated_rate = -BUDGET$TotalDecay) # net production

# O2 mass balance check
c(flux_difference =  BUDGET$O2efflux - BUDGET$O2influx,
  integrated_rate = -BUDGET$TotalDecay + BUDGET$TotalAeration) # net production
```

Tables in R Markdown can also be displayed in a prettier way using ``kable`` from the ``knitr`` package:

```{r}
budget <- data.frame(quantity=names(unlist(BUDGET)), 
                     value=unlist(BUDGET), 
                     row.names = NULL)
knitr::kable(budget, digits = 3, col.names = c("quantity", "mol/m2/d"))
```
