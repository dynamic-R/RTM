# Introduction

This template file contains a simple one-dimensional reaction-transport model describing the dynamics of oxygen (O2) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), both expressed in units of mol/m3, in an estuary that is in contact with the air. 

The model domain is divided into a grid with N equally sized boxes (N=100).

Both BOD and O2 are *vectors* with a length of N. They represent the concentrations of the state variables in the *center* of the boxes.

With regard to the reaction, a simple first-order decay of BOD that is limited by oxygen is assumed. This reaction consumes both BOD and O2. O2 is also exchanged with the atmosphere.

The species are modeled with the following boundary conditions:

* BOD: imposed flux upstream (*flux.up*), imposed concentration downstream (*C.down*).
* O2: imposed concentration upstream (*C.up*), zero-gradient boundary downstream (default, need not be specified).

The partial derivatives related to transport are approximated with function tran.1D from the ReacTran package. The steady-state and dynamic solutions are obtained using functions from the rootSolve and deSolve package respectively. The latter two packages are loaded together with ReacTran.

# Model solution

## Dynamic solution

```{r}
outtimes <- seq(from = 1, to = 100, length.out = 100)   # output times

# ode.1D integrates the 1D model 
# It needs the number (nspec) and names of species, and the dimension (dimens).
out <- ode.1D(y = yini, parms = pars, func = BOD1D, times = outtimes, 
              names = SVnames, nspec = length(SVnames), dimens = N)                
```

Output the solution as an image, time plot, and lines.

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
image(out, grid = Grid$x.mid, ylab = "distance (m)", legend = TRUE)

# each curve represents the solution at a given time point
matplot.1D(out, type = "l", lty = 1, col = "grey")
```
```{r, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
plot(out, which=c("MeanDecay", "MeanAeration", "O2influx", "BODinflux"), 
          ylab=c("mol/m3/d","mol/m3/d","mol/m2/d","mol/m2/d"))
```

## Steady-state solution

```{r}
# find steady state solution
std <- steady.1D(y = yini, parms = pars, func = BOD1D, 
          positive = TRUE,               # to ensure that the solution is positive
          names = SVnames, nspec = length(SVnames), dimens = N,
          atol = 1e-10, rtol = 1e-10)    # to increase the precision of the solution

names(std)          # std holds the state variables (y) and ordinary variables
head(std$y, n = 2)  # std$y contains the state variables (matrix)
```

A second run without reaeration

```{r}
p2 <- pars              # copy of parameter vector
p2["k"] <- 0            # set reaeration parameter = 0

std2 <- steady.1D(y = yini, parms = p2, func = BOD1D, 
          positive = TRUE,               # to ensure that the solution is positive
          names = SVnames, nspec = length(SVnames), dimens = N,
          atol = 1e-10, rtol = 1e-10)    # to increase the precision of the solution
```

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
plot(std, std2, grid = Grid$x.mid, ylab = "mol/m3") # plot the state variables
```

```{r, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
plot(std, std2, grid = Grid$x.mid, 
     which=c("BOD", "O2", "Decay", "Aeration"),  # plot state variables and reaction rates
     ylab =c("mol/m3","mol/m3","mol/m3/d", "mol/m3/d")) 
```

## Budgetting:

```{r}
toselect <- c("TotalDecay", "TotalAeration", "O2influx", "O2efflux", "BODinflux", "BODefflux")
BUDGET   <- std[toselect]
unlist(BUDGET)

# should be same
BUDGET$BODinflux - BUDGET$BODefflux  
BUDGET$TotalDecay

# should be ~0
BUDGET$O2influx - BUDGET$O2efflux -BUDGET$TotalDecay + BUDGET$TotalAeration
```
