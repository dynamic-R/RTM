# Introduction

This template contains an R implementation of a simple one-dimensional reaction-transport model in a porous medium. You are free to use and expand it based on your needs.  

The model domain is divided into a grid of $N$ boxes. Rather than having equally-sized boxes, the box size (width of the depth interval) *increases exponentially* with depth. This is because reaction rates are typically highest close to the upper boundary (here: sediment-water interface, SWI), resulting in steep concentration gradients there. In contrast, reaction rates are typically much lower close to the lower boundary (here: deeper in the sediment), resulting in shallower spatial gradients. To achieve good numerical precision at locations where steep gradients might occur, it is therefore a good idea to have smaller box sizes close to the upper boundary, and larger box sizes close to the lower boundary.

Two species (*POC* and *DIC*) are modeled with the following boundary conditions:

* POC: particulate organic carbon, [mol POC/m3 solid]
  - imposed flux at the upstream boundary (flux.up), 
  - zero-gradient at the downstream boundary,
* DIC: dissolved inorganic carbon, [mol DIC/m3 liquid] 
  - imposed concentration at the upstream boundary (C.up), 
  - zero-gradient at the downstream boundary.

The biogeochemical process is the first-order mineralization of POC to DIC, with a stoichiometry of 1:1 (i.e., POC $\rightarrow$ DIC).

Units: length in $m$, time in $d$, concentrations in $mol~m^{-3}$, fluxes in $mol~m^{-2}~d^{-1}$. 

Due to sediment compaction, porosity ($[m^3~liquid~m^{-3}~bulk]$) decreases exponentially with depth from 0.9 at the sediment-water interface to 0.7 in the deep sediment, with a depth attenuation factor of $100~m^{-1}$. Salinity is $S=35$, temperature is $t=20~^\circ$C.

# R implementation

The partial derivatives related to transport are approximated by the function ``tran.1D()`` from the *ReacTran* package. The steady-state and dynamic solutions are obtained using functions from the *rootSolve* and *deSolve* package, respectively. The latter two packages are loaded together with *ReacTran.* The diffusion coefficients are obtained using the *marelac* package.

```{r, message = FALSE}
require(marelac)
require(ReacTran)
```

## The model grid and associated properties

First, we discretise the spatial domain into a grid, and evaluate on this grid the model parameters that vary with depth in the sediment, including the porosity, solid volume fraction, and the diffusion coefficient. Note that we need to evaluate the diffusion coefficient at the box *interfaces* to be able to later calculate the transport fluxes at the box interfaces!

```{r}
# units: time=days, space=meters, amount=moles, concentration=mol/m3

# spatial domain
Length    <- 0.20   # [m]
N         <- 200    # number of grid cells

# grid with equally sized boxes (not used here, see next R-command)
Grid      <- setup.grid.1D(L = Length, N = N)

# grid with an exponentially increasing grid size, starting from 0.05 cm (5e-4 m)
Grid      <- setup.grid.1D(L = Length, N = N, dx.1 = 0.05/100)

# function describing the variation of porosity (volume fraction of LIQUID) with depth
porFun.L  <- function(x, por.SWI, por.deep, porcoef)
  return( por.deep + (por.SWI-por.deep)*exp(-x*porcoef) )

# function describing the SOLID volume fraction (svf = 1 - porosity)
porFun.S  <- function(x, por.SWI, por.deep, porcoef)
  return( 1 - porFun.L(x, por.SWI, por.deep, porcoef) )

# calculate porosity and svf on the grid (mid-points and box interfaces, etc.)
porLiquid <- setup.prop.1D(func=porFun.L, grid=Grid, por.SWI=0.9, por.deep=0.7, porcoef=100)
porSolid  <- setup.prop.1D(func=porFun.S, grid=Grid, por.SWI=0.9, por.deep=0.7, porcoef=100)

# Sediment diffusion coefficient for HCO3^-, defined at box interfaces!! (N+1 values)
diff.DIC  <- diffcoeff(S=35, t=20)$HCO3 * 3600*24  # converted from m2/s to m2/d
porInt    <- porLiquid$int                         # porosity at the box interfaces            
diffDIC   <- diff.DIC/(1-log(porInt^2))            # corrected for tortuosity
```

Visualise these settings.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=2.7}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(porLiquid, type="l", grid = Grid, xyswap = TRUE, ylab = "depth (m)", 
     main = "porosity", xlab = "m3_liquid / m3_bulk")
plot(porSolid,  type="l", grid = Grid, xyswap = TRUE, ylab = "depth (m)", 
     main = "svf = 1-porosity", xlab = "m3_solid / m3_bulk")
plot(diffDIC, y = Grid$x.int, type="l", ylim = c(Length,0), ylab = "depth (m)", 
     main = "sediment diff. coeff (DIC)", xlab = "m2/d")
```

## Other model parameters

Next, we specify the model parameters that do *not* vary with depth in the sediment. Note that although the variation of porosity with depth in the sediment influences the advective velocity, we will ignore this in our model.

```{r}
parms <- c(
  Dbio     = 5e-4/365, # [m2/d]        bioturbation mixing coefficient
  v_adv    = 5e-6,     # [m/d]         sediment accretion (=advection) velocity 
  kMin     = 0.005,    # [/d]          POC mineralisation rate constant
  depoPOC  = 1e-3,     # [molPOC/m2/d] POC deposition rate (flux at SWI)
  bwDIC    = 2,        # [molDIC/m3]   DIC concentration at SWI
  POC2DIC  = 1         # [mol/mol]     Stoichiometry of reaction POC -> DIC
)
```

## Definition and initialisation of state variables

```{r}
POC.ini  <- rep(0, length = N)      # initial conditions 
DIC.ini  <- rep(0, length = N)
state    <- c(POC.ini, DIC.ini)     # note the order
names    <- c("POC", "DIC")
nspec    <- length(names)
```

## Definition of the model function

Next, we define the model function that calculates the *time-derivatives*. In the model function, both POC and DIC are vectors, representing concentrations in the *middle* of the grid boxes (*N* values each). The state variable vector (*state*) is first "split" into these two components, and their transport are estimated using the *tran.1D* function. Note that the concentrations are expressed in *moles per volume fraction*; thus the units depend on whether the state variable is a solute or a solid! Also note the *correction for porosity and stoichiometry* when calculating the *reaction rates* for each state variable! The return value from this function contains the vector with the time-derivatives, and ordinary output variables that will be useful later on, packed in a list.

```{r}
Diamodel <- function (t, state, pars)   # state is a LONG vector
{
  with (as.list(pars),{ 
    
    # unpack state variables
    POC <- state[ (0*N+1) : (1*N) ]    # first N elements: POC
    DIC <- state[ (1*N+1) : (2*N) ]    # next N elements:  DIC

    # === transport rates ===
    # note: zero gradient by default at lower boundaries
 
    # solid substances, VF = solid volume fraction = 1-porosity!    
    tran.POC <- tran.1D(C = POC, flux.up = depoPOC,  # upper boundary: flux 
                        dx = Grid, VF = porSolid,    # grid and volume fraction (1-por)
                        D = Dbio, v = v_adv)         # mixing (bioturbation) and advection

    # dissolved substances, VF = liquid volume fraction = porosity!
    tran.DIC <- tran.1D(C = DIC, C.up = bwDIC,       # upper boundary: concentration
                        dx = Grid, VF = porLiquid,   # grid and volume fraction (por)
                        D = diffDIC, v = v_adv)      # diffusive mixing and advection
                                                     # (bioturbation mixing negligible)
 
    # === reaction rates ===
    # POC mineralisation
    Miner <- kMin * POC   # [molPOC/m3 SOLID/d] (per volume of solid!)

    # more rate expressions can be added here ...
    
    # === mass balances : dC/dt = transport + reactions ===
    
    # solid substances
    dPOC.dt <- ( tran.POC$dC                   # transport
                -Miner )                       # reactions, [molPOC/m3 SOLID/d] !!
    
    # dissolved substances
    por     <-   porLiquid$mid                 # porosity in the middle of grid cells
    dDIC.dt <- ( tran.DIC$dC +                 # transport
                 POC2DIC*Miner * (1-por)/por ) # reactions, [molDIC/m3 LIQUID/d] !!

    # depth-integrated rates: [molPOC/m2 BULK/d] !!
    svf      <- porSolid$mid                   # svf in the middle of grid cells
    TotalMin <- sum(Miner*Grid$dx*svf)         # depth-integration
  
    return(list(c(dPOC.dt, dDIC.dt),           # the time-derivatives, as a long vector
          Mineralisation = Miner,              # Mineralisation rates, as a vector
             
          # for creating budgets
          TotalMin      = TotalMin,            # [molPOC/m2 BULK/d]
          DIC.SWI.Flux  = tran.DIC$flux.up,    # [molDIC/m2 BULK/d]
          DIC.Deep.Flux = tran.DIC$flux.down,  # [molDIC/m2 BULK/d]
          POC.SWI.Flux  = tran.POC$flux.up,    # [molPOC/m2 BULK/d]
          POC.Deep.Flux = tran.POC$flux.down)) # [molPOC/m2 BULK/d]
 })
}
```

## Steady-state solution

Finding a steady-state solution is done with the function *steady.1D* from the package *rootSolve*. This function requires an initial guess of the steady-state solution. A vector of zeros is a good enough first guess. Note that the length of this vector is $2N$, where 2 is the number of state variables.

In this example, three steady-state solutions are calculated, each corresponding to a different organic matter deposition rate.

```{r}
p0 <- p1 <- p2 <- parms      # three runs with different POC deposition rates

p0["depoPOC"]  <- 0          # molPOC/m2/day
std0 <- steady.1D (y=state, func=Diamodel, parms=p0, 
                   nspec=nspec, dimens=N, names=names,
                   positive = TRUE)     # to have only positive values! 

p1["depoPOC"]  <- 1e-3       # molPOC/m2/day
std1 <- steady.1D (y=state, func=Diamodel, parms=p1, 
                   nspec=nspec, dimens=N, names=names,
                   positive = TRUE)     

p2["depoPOC"]  <- 2e-3       # molPOC/m2/day
std2 <- steady.1D (y=state, func=Diamodel, parms=p2, 
                   nspec=nspec, dimens=N, names=names,
                   positive = TRUE) 
```

### Plotting

Here, we visualise the steady state solutions, including the depth profile of the process rate.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
plot(std0, std1, std2, xyswap=TRUE, grid=Grid$x.mid, lty=1, lwd=2,
     which = c("POC",           "DIC",            "Mineralisation"  ),
     xlab  = c("molC/m3 Solid", "molC/m3 Liquid", "molC/m3 Solid/d"), 
     ylab  = "depth (m)", mfrow=c(1,3))

legend("bottomright", legend=c("0", "1e-3", "2e-3"), title="depoPOC (mol/m2/d)",
       lwd=2, lty=1, col=1:3)
```

### Budget

First, we check the fluxes at the domain boundaries. We only do this for the steady-state solution *std1*.
Note that although there is no DIC gradient at the lower boundary (default boundary condition, see graphs above), the efflux of DIC in the deep sediment is *not* zero. This efflux is due to *advective* transport, which is equal to $v\cdot C \cdot \phi$ (see lectures), so non-zero whenever the concentration *and* advective velocity are non-zero!

```{r}
toselect <- c("TotalMin", "DIC.SWI.Flux", "DIC.Deep.Flux", 
              "POC.SWI.Flux", "POC.Deep.Flux")
BUDGET   <- std1[toselect]
unlist(BUDGET)    # show result
```

To verify that our mass balances are correct, we construct the total C budget in the modelled sediment column. We require that, for each state variable, the *difference between fluxes* at the lower and upper boundaries should be **equal** to the *net production rate* integrated along the domain. In other words, what goes *out* at the *lower* boundary minus what comes *in* at the *upper* boundary must be equal to the total *net* production rate *within* the domain! Indeed, the output values confirm this.

```{r}
# POC mass balance check
c(flux_difference =  BUDGET$POC.Deep.Flux - BUDGET$POC.SWI.Flux, 
  integrated_rate = -BUDGET$TotalMin) # net production

# DIC mass balance check
c(flux_difference =  BUDGET$DIC.Deep.Flux - BUDGET$DIC.SWI.Flux, 
  integrated_rate =  BUDGET$TotalMin) # net production
```

## Dynamic solution

The model can be run dynamically with the function *ode.1D* from the package *deSolve*. This requires a good set of initial conditions. 

We use the steady-state solution found above for the POC deposition flux of $1\times 10^{-3}~mol~m^{-2}~d^{-1}$ (*std1*). We then increase the deposition rate 10-fold and run the model for 2 years.

```{r}
times          <- seq(from = 0, to = 2*365, by = 10)
p2             <- parms
p2["depoPOC"]  <- parms["depoPOC"]*10         # molPOC/m2/day
out            <- ode.1D(y=std1$y, func=Diamodel, parms=p2, times = times,
                         nspec=nspec, dimens=N, names=names )
```

### Extracting variables

We can use function *subset* to extract variables from the output. The object will have dimension ``(length(times), length(x))``.

The output times will not be returned by this function, but it is stored in the objects attributes.

```{r}
POC <- subset(out, which = "POC")
dim(POC)
times <- attributes(POC)$time 
```

### Plotting

We can now plot the profile of POC at a certain time (day) or the times-series of POC at a particular location (depth).

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=3.5}
day <- 20 # specified as index(!) of the time vector --> real time = times[day]
POC_t <- POC[day,]
plot(y=Grid$x.mid, x=POC_t, ylim=c(0.10,0), type="l", ylab="depth (m)",
     xlab="molPOC/m3 solid", main = paste("POC profile at day", times[day]))
```

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=3.5, fig.align='center'}
depth <- 20 # specified as index(!) of the depth vector --> real depth = Grid$x.mid[depth]
POC_x <- POC[,depth]
plot(x=times, y=POC_x, type = "l", ylab="molPOC/m3 solid", xlab="time (d)",
     main=paste("POC dynamics at ",format(Grid$x.mid[depth],digits=2),"m"))
```

Plot output as an image.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
par(mar = c(4,4,4,4))
image(out, legend = TRUE, grid = Grid$x.mid, ylim = c(Length,0), 
      las = 1, ylab = "depth (m)", xlab="time (d)")
```

Plot output as lines showing the depth distribution for all time points.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
matplot.1D(out, type = "l", grid = Grid$x.mid, 
      col = grey(seq(0.2,0.8,len=length(times))), # This will use a sequence of greys
                                                  # grey(1) = white, grey(0) = black
      las = 1, xyswap = TRUE, lty = 1, ylab="depth (m)",
      xlab = c("molPOC/m3 SOLID", "molDIC/m3 LIQUID"))
```

We also plot the fluxes at the SWI and in the deep sediment as a function of time. The POC flux at the SWI should be constant, as specified by the boundary condition at the SWI.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=3}
plot(out, which = c("DIC.SWI.Flux", "DIC.Deep.Flux", 
                    "POC.SWI.Flux", "POC.Deep.Flux"), 
     mfrow=c(1,4), # modify the plot arrangement (1 row, 4 columns)
     xlab="time (d)", ylab="molC/m2/d")
```

The miniscule but detectable increase in the POC flux at the lower boundary shows that for the given POC input at the SWI, not all POC is converted into DIC within the sediment column of 20 cm! The rest is self-explanatory.
