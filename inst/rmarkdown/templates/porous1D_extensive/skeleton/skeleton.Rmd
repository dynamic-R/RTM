# Introduction

This template file contains a simple one-dimensional reaction-transport model in a porous medium. 

The model domain is divided into a grid of $N$ boxes. Rather than having equally-sized boxes, the box size (width of the depth interval) *increases exponentially* with depth. This is because reaction rates are typically highest close to the upper boundary (here: sediment-water interface, SWI), resulting in steep concentration gradients there. In contrast, reaction rates are typically much lower close to the lower boundary (here: deeper in the sediment), resulting in shallower spatial gradients. To achieve good numerical precision at locations where steep gradients might occur, it is therefore a good idea to have smaller box sizes close to the upper boundary, and larger box sizes close to the lower boundary.

Two species (*POC* and *DIC*) are modeled with the following boundary conditions:

* POC: particulate organic carbon, [mol/m3 solid]
  - imposed flux at the upstream boundary (flux.up), 
  - zero-gradient at the downstream boundary,
* DIC: dissolved inorganic carbon, [mol/m3 liquid] 
  - imposed concentration at the upstream boundary (C.up), 
  - zero-gradient at the downstream boundary.

The biogeochemical process is the first-order mineralization of POC to DIC.

Units: length in $m$, time in $d$, concentrations in $mol~m^{-3}$, fluxes in $mol~m^{-2}~d^{-1}$. 

Due to sediment compaction, porosity ($[m^3~liquid~m^{-3}~bulk]$) decreases exponentially with depth from 0.9 at the sediment-water interface to 0.7 in the deep sediment, with a depth attenuation factor of $100~m^{-1}$. Salinity is $S=35$, temperature is $t=20~^\circ$C.

# R implementation

The partial derivatives related to transport are approximated by the function tran.1D from the ReacTran package. The steady-state and dynamic solutions are obtained using functions from the rootSolve and deSolve package. The latter two packages are loaded together with ReacTran. The diffusion coefficients are obtained using the marelac package.

```{r, message = FALSE}
require(marelac)
require(ReacTran)
```

## The model grid and associated properties

First, we discretise the spatial domain into a grid, and evaluate on this grid the model parameters that vary with depth in the sediment, including the porosity, solid volume fraction, and the diffusion coefficient. Note that we need to evaluate the diffusion coefficient at the box *interfaces* to be able to later calculate the transport fluxes at the box interfaces!

```{r}
# spatial domain: total length of 20 cm, 200 boxes
Length    <- 0.20   # [m]
N         <- 200
# grid with equally sized boxes (not used here)
Grid      <- setup.grid.1D(L = Length, N = N)

# grid with an exponentially increasing grid size, starting from 0.05 cm (5e-4m)
Grid      <- setup.grid.1D(L = Length, N = N, dx.1 = 0.05/100)

# function describing the variation of porosity (volume fraction of LIQUID) with depth
porFun.L  <- function(x, por.SWI, por.deep, porcoef)
  return( por.deep + (por.SWI-por.deep)*exp(-x*porcoef) )

# function describing the SOLID volume fraction (svf = 1-porosity)
porFun.S  <- function(x, por.SWI, por.deep, porcoef)
  return( 1-porFun.L(x, por.SWI, por.deep, porcoef) )

# calculate porosity and svf on the grid (mid-points and box interfaces, etc.)
porLiquid <- setup.prop.1D(func=porFun.L, grid=Grid, por.SWI=0.9, por.deep=0.7, porcoef=100)
porSolid  <- setup.prop.1D(func=porFun.S, grid=Grid, por.SWI=0.9, por.deep=0.7, porcoef=100)

# Sediment diffusion coefficient for HCO3^- (m2/d), defined at box interfaces!! (N+1 values)
diff.DIC  <- diffcoeff(S=35, t=20)$HCO3 * 3600*24  # m2/s to m2/d
porInt    <- porLiquid$int                         # porosity at the box interfaces            
diffDIC   <- diff.DIC/(1-log(porInt^2))            # corrected for tortuosity
```

Visualise these settings:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=2.7}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(porLiquid, type="l", grid = Grid, xyswap = TRUE, ylab = "depth (m)", 
     main = "porosity", xlab = "m3_liquid / m3_bulk")
plot(porSolid,  type="l", grid = Grid, xyswap = TRUE, ylab = "depth (m)", 
     main = "svf = 1-porosity", xlab = "m3_solid / m3_bulk")
plot(diffDIC, y = Grid$x.int, type="l", ylim = c(Length,0), ylab = "depth (m)", 
     main = "sediment diff. coeff (DIC)", xlab = "m2/d")
```

## Other model parameters

Next, we specify the model parameters that do *not* vary with depth in the sediment. Note that although the variation of porosity with depth in the sediment influences the advective velocity, we will ignore this in our model.

```{r}
parms <- c(
 Dbio     = 5e-4/365,   # [m2/d]      bioturbation mixing coefficient
 v_adv    = 5e-6,       # [m/d]       sediment advection velocity   
 rMin     = 0.005,      # [/d]        POC mineralisation rate constant
 depoPOC  = 1e-3,       # [mol/m2/d]  POC deposition rate (flux at SWI)
 bwDIC    = 2           # [mol/m3]    DIC concentration at SWI
)
```

## Definition and initialisation of state variables

```{r}
names    <- c("POC", "DIC")
nspec    <- length(names)
POC.ini  <- rep(0, length = N)      # initial conditions 
DIC.ini  <- rep(0, length = N)
state    <- c(POC.ini, DIC.ini)
```

## Definition of the model function

Next, we define the model function that calculates the *time-derivatives*. In the model function, both POC and DIC are vectors, representing concentrations in the *middle* of the grid boxes (*N* values each). The state variable vector (*state*) is first "split" into these two components, and their transport are estimated using the *tran.1D* function. Note that the concentrations are expressed in *moles per volume fraction*; thus the units depend on whether the state variable is a solute or a solid! Also note the *correction for porosity* when calculating the *reaction rates* for each state variable! The return value from this function contains the vector with the time-derivatives, and ordinary output variables that will be useful later on, packed in a list.

```{r}
Diamodel <- function (t, state, pars)   # state is a LONG vector
{
  with (as.list(pars),{ 
    
    # unpack state variables
    POC <- state[   1 :   N ]    # first N elements: POC
    DIC <- state[(N+1):(2*N)]    # next N elements:  DIC

    # === transport rates ===
    # note: zero gradient by default at lower boundaries
 
    # solid substances, VF = solid volume fraction = 1-porosity!    
    tran.POC <- tran.1D(C = POC, flux.up = depoPOC,  # upper boundary: flux 
                        dx = Grid, VF = porSolid,    # grid and volume fraction (1-por)
                        D = Dbio, v = v_adv)         # mixing (bioturbation) and advection

    # dissolved substances, VF = liquid volume fraction = porosity!
    tran.DIC <- tran.1D(C = DIC, C.up = bwDIC,       # upper boundary: concentration
                        dx = Grid, VF = porLiquid,   # grid and volume fraction (por)
                        D = diffDIC, v = v_adv)      # diffusive mixing and advection
                                                     # (bioturbation mixing negligible)
 
    # === reaction rates ===
    # POC mineralisation
    Mineralisation <- rMin * POC   # [mol/m3 SOLID/d] (per volume of solid!)

    # more rate expressions can be added here ...
    
    # === mass balances : dC/dt = transport + reactions ===
    
    # solid substances
    dPOC.dt   <- ( tran.POC$dC                       # transport
                 - Mineralisation )                  # reactions, [mol/m3 SOLID/d] !!
    
    # dissolved substances
    poro      <- porLiquid$mid
    dDIC.dt   <- ( tran.DIC$dC +                     # transport
                   Mineralisation * (1-poro)/poro )  # reactions, [mol/m3 LIQUID/d] !!

    # depth-integrated rates: [mol/m2 BULK/d] !!
    TotalMin  <- sum(Mineralisation*Grid$dx*porSolid$mid)
  
    return(list(c(dPOC.dt, dDIC.dt),            # the time-derivatives, as a long vector
          Mineralisation = Mineralisation,      # Mineralisation rates, as a vector
             
          # for creating budgets
          TotalMin      = TotalMin,             # [mol/m2 BULK/d]
          DIC.SWI.Flux  = tran.DIC$flux.up,     # [mol/m2 BULK/d]
          DIC.Deep.Flux = tran.DIC$flux.down,   # [mol/m2 BULK/d]
          POC.SWI.Flux  = tran.POC$flux.up,     # [mol/m2 BULK/d]
          POC.Deep.Flux = tran.POC$flux.down))  # [mol/m2 BULK/d]
 })
}
```

## Steady-state solution

Finding a steady-state solution is done with the function *steady.1D* from the package rootSolve.
This function requires an initial guess of the steady-state solution. 
A vector of zeros is a good enough first guess. Note that the length of this vector is $2N$, where 2 is the number of state variables.

In this example, three steady-state solutions are calculated, each corresponding to a different organic matter deposition rate.

```{r}
p0 <- p1 <- p2 <- parms      # three runs with different deposition rates

p0["depoPOC"]  <- 0          # mol/m2/day
std0 <- steady.1D (y=state, func=Diamodel, parms=p0, 
                   nspec=nspec, dimens=N, names=names,
                   positive = TRUE)     # to have only positive values! 

p1["depoPOC"]  <- 1e-3       # mol/m2/day
std1 <- steady.1D (y=state, func=Diamodel, parms=p1, 
                   nspec=nspec, dimens=N, names=names,
                   positive = TRUE)     

p2["depoPOC"]  <- 2e-3       # mol/m2/day
std2 <- steady.1D (y=state, func=Diamodel, parms=p2, 
                   nspec=nspec, dimens=N, names=names,
                   positive = TRUE) 
```

### Plotting

Here, we visualize the steady state solutions, including the depth profile of the process rate.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
plot(std0, std1, std2, xyswap=TRUE, grid=Grid$x.mid, lty=1, lwd=2,
     which = c("POC",            "DIC",             "Mineralisation"  ),
     xlab  = c("molC/m3 Solid", "molC/m3 Liquid", "molC/m3 Solid/d"), 
     ylab  = "depth (m)", mfrow=c(1,3))

legend("bottomright", legend=c("0", "1e-3", "2e-3"), title="mol/m2/d", 
       lwd=2, lty=1, col=1:3)
```

### Budget

First, we check the fluxes at the domain boundaries. We only do this for the steady-state solution std1.
Note that although there is no DIC gradient at the lower boundary (default boundary condition, see graphs above), the efflux of DIC in the deep sediment is *not* zero. This efflux is due to *advective* transport, which is equal to $v\cdot C \cdot \phi$ (see lectures), so non-zero whenever the concentration *and* advective velocity are non-zero!

```{r}
toselect <- c("TotalMin", "DIC.SWI.Flux", "DIC.Deep.Flux", "POC.SWI.Flux", "POC.Deep.Flux")
BUDGET   <- std1[toselect]
unlist(BUDGET)    # show result
```

To verify that our mass balances are correct, we construct the total C budget in the modelled sediment column. What goes *out* at the *lower* boundary minus what comes *in* at the *upper* boundary must be equal to the total (i.e., depth-integrated) *net* production rate *within* the domain! Indeed, the output values confirm this.

```{r}
# should be the same:
# net POC rate is negative => POC is net removed within the domain
c(BUDGET$POC.Deep.Flux - BUDGET$POC.SWI.Flux, -BUDGET$TotalMin)
# net DIC rate is positive => DIC is net produced within the domain
c(BUDGET$DIC.Deep.Flux - BUDGET$DIC.SWI.Flux,  BUDGET$TotalMin)
```

## Dynamic solution

The model can be run dynamically with the function *ode.1D* from the package deSolve.
This requires a good set of initial conditions. 

We use the steady-state solution found above for the POC deposition flux of $1~10^{-3}~mol~m^{-2}~d^{-1}$ (*std1*). We then increase the deposition rate 10-fold and run the model for 2 years.

```{r}
times          <- seq(from = 0, to = 2*365, by = 10)
p2             <- parms
p2["depoPOC"]  <- parms["depoPOC"]*10         # mol/m2/day
out            <- ode.1D( y=std1$y, func=Diamodel, parms=p2, times = times,
                          nspec=nspec, dimens=N, names=names )
```

### Extracting variables

We can use function *subset* to extract variables from the output. The object will have dimension (length(times), length(x)).

The output times will not be returned by this function, but it is stored in the objects attributes.

```{r}
POC <- subset(out, which = "POC")
dim(POC)
times <- attributes(POC)$time 
```

Based on that, we can plot the times-series of POC at a particular depth, or the profile of POC at a certain time:

```{r}
POC_t <- POC[20,]
plot(y=Grid$x.mid, x=POC_t, ylim=c(0.10,0), type="l", ylab="depth, m",
  xlab="mol/m3 solid", main = paste("POC profile at day", times[20]))
```

```{r}
POC_x <- POC[,20]
plot(x=times, y=POC_x, type = "l", ylab="mol/m3 solid",
  main=paste("POC dynamics at ",format(Grid$x.mid[20],digits=2),"m"))
```

### Plotting

Output as an image.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
par(mar = c(4,4,4,4))
image(out, legend = TRUE, grid = Grid$x.mid, ylim = c(Length,0), 
      las = 1, ylab = "depth (m)", xlab="time (d)")
```

Output as lines showing the depth distribution for all time points.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
matplot.1D(out, type = "l", grid = Grid$x.mid, 
      col = grey(seq(0.2,0.8,len=length(times))), # This will use a sequence of greyish colors
                                                  # grey(1) = white, grey(0) = black
      las = 1, xyswap = TRUE, lty = 1, ylab="depth (m)",
      xlab = c("mol/m3 SOLID", "mol/m3 LIQUID"))
```


### simple plots

We also plot the fluxes at the SWI and in the deep sediment as a function of time. The POC flux at the SWI should be constant, as specified by the boundary condition at the SWI.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=3}
plot(out, which = c("DIC.SWI.Flux", "DIC.Deep.Flux", "POC.SWI.Flux", "POC.Deep.Flux"), 
     mfrow=c(1,4), xlab="time (d)", ylab="mol/m2/d")
```

The miniscule but detectable increase in the POC flux at the lower boundary shows that for the given POC input at the SWI, not all POC is converted into DIC within the sediment column of 20 cm! The rest is self-explanatory.
