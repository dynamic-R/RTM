# Methods

The Methods section describes the "how". It should explain 

* the theoretical underpinning of the model (state variables, including units, conceptual diagram, chemical equations, if relevant, mass balance equations);
* key assumptions (rate expressions, boundary conditions);
* model implementation in R (model parameters & state variables, model function).

## Including external figures

If you want to include an external figure in the report (e.g., stored in a file ``NitBudget.png``), you can do so using the following markdown sentence:

``![This is an external figure.](NitBudget.png){width=70%}``

![This is an external figure.](NitBudget.png){width=70%}

The result will look as shown in Figure 1.

## Including equations

When writing chemical or mathematical equations, you can use \LaTeX\ commands within the Rmd file. For example:

* Displayed chemical equation without a label:
$$CH_2O + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O$$

* Displayed chemical equation with a label:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:miner}
CH_2O + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O
\end{equation}

* Displayed mathematical equation with a label:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq1}
\frac{\partial O_2}{\partial t} = Transport(O_2) + R_{aeration} - R_{miner}
\end{equation}
The label can then be used to reference Eq. \ref{eq1} and Eq. \ref{eq:miner} even if you change the order of equations later on.

## Model implementation in R

It is a good idea to include the full R-code of your model. If the model is complex, it may also be worthwhile to explain the key components of the model implementation. 

As an example, here we include the implementation of the BOD model (available in the ``RTM_1D`` template).

  })
}

## Modeled scenarios

After showing the R-code implementing the model, it is useful to explain the details of specific modeled scenarios or other types of analyses performed with the model (e.g., sensitivity analysis, fitting, or budgetting). The results can be calculated but not yet displayed (they will be displayed in the Results section). 

For example, here we find a steady-state solution for the default model parameters.

```{r}
std <- steady.1D(y = state.ini, parms = pars, func = BOD1D, 
          positive = TRUE, names = SVnames, nspec = length(SVnames), dimens = N,
          atol = 1e-10, rtol = 1e-10) 
```

In contrast, here we solve the model assuming no aeration.

```{r}
p2 <- pars
p2["kAeration"] <- 0
std2 <- steady.1D(y = state.ini, parms = p2, func = BOD1D, 
          positive = TRUE, names = SVnames, nspec = length(SVnames), dimens = N,
          atol = 1e-10, rtol = 1e-10)
```

Here, we construct the $O_2$ and $BOD$ budget for the modeled domain and store it in a format (a ``data.frame``) that can be displayed as a nice table in the Results section.

```{r}
toselect <- c("TotalDecay", "TotalAeration", "BODinflux", "BODefflux",
              "O2influx", "O2efflux")
BUDGET <- data.frame(default     = unlist(std[toselect]), 
                     no_aeration = unlist(std2[toselect]))
```

This can go on until you clarify all methodological aspects covered in your project.
