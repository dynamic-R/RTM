# Crop and weed model including economics --- Answers

To estimate the net financial gain for the farmer, we need to take into account all costs and profits associated with the cultivation and sale of the plants.

We do this by adding an extra state variable: the integrated cost. Its dynamics are quite simple:

The *Cost* increases with the daily expenditures of culturing (labor), which is either 1 euro per $m^2$ and per week ($1~EUR~m^{-2}~wk^{-1}$) if there is no continuous fertilization, or $1.025~EUR~m^{-2}~wk^{-1}$ if continuous fertilization *is* performed. Additionally, the costs are augmented with the cost of the fertiliser. 

We write for the balance equations:
$$\frac{dCost}{dt} = laborCost + costP\times Padded$$
Here Cost is in $EUR~m^{-2}$, and the rates are in $EUR~m^{-2}~d^{-1}$.

The initial cost of planting is $Cost_{ini}=0.5~EUR~m^{-2}$. 

In case the fertilisation is done before planting, we need to also include the labor cost and depreciation of material used ($5~EUR~m^{-2}$) in addition to the cost of the fertiliser.

The model is solved thrice over 90 days. 

* Run 1 implements continuous P addition.
* Run 2 implements one-time P fertilization.
* Run 3 implements continuous P addition at a *quarter* of the fertilization rate compared to run 1.

The 3rd run is used to assess the environmental and economic impact of reduced fertilization rate.

```{r, fig.height = 10.5, fig.width = 10}
# output time
outtimes <- seq(from = 0, to = 90, length.out = 100)  # run for 3 months

# Continuous P-addition
state["COST"] <- 0.5             # price of planting & fertilizer cost
out <- ode(y = state, parms = parms, func = Crops, times = outtimes)

# Initial P ferilisation
# Change the parameter values and initial conditions
parms2 <- parms
parms2["Paddition"] <- 0.0       # no continuous fertilization
parms2["laborCost"] <- 1./7      # slightly cheaper if no continuous fertilization

state2 <- state
state2["P1"] <- 1                # higher value for P1
state2["COST"] <- 0.5 + 5 + 0.9 * parms["PCost"] # price of planting, initial 
                                                 # fertilisation (labor) & fertilizer cost 
                                                 # (0.9 mol P m-2 is added)
out2 <- ode(y = state2, parms = parms2, func = Crops, times = outtimes)

# Continuous P-addition at a quarter of the original rate
state3 <- state
parms3 <- parms
parms3["Paddition"] <- parms3["Paddition"]*0.25
out3 <- ode(y = state, parms = parms3, func = Crops, times = outtimes)

# visualise results
plot(out, out2, out3, lty = 1, lwd = 2, mfrow=c(4,4))
abline(h = 0)   # above the line: true profit; below the line: loss.
plot.new()
legend("topleft", c("continuous",  "initial", "continuous-quarter"), 
       col = 1:3, lty = 1, lwd = 2)
```

Based on the discussion of the previous results, one can discuss independently the economic and environmental implications of these model results --- the graphs speak for themselves.
