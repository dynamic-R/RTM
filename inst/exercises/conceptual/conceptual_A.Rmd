# Exercise 1 ANSWER. Lake biomanipulation

![Conceptual scheme of the lake biomanipulation model.](images/conceptual_lake.png){width=10cm}

* Possible forcing function could be **f1**, the inflow of DIP
* Suitable units: mol P $m^{-3}$
* The effects of biomanipulation can be investigated by changing **f10**.

# Exercise 2 ANSWER.	Bacterial decay of particulate organic matter in marine sediments

![Conceptual scheme of the bacteria-detritus model.](images/conceptual_detritus.png){width=10cm}

Note that respiration consists of two parts: *basal* respiration (a continuous process that occurs regardless whether bacteria grow or not), and *growth* respiration (linked to bacterial growth).

# Exercise 3 ANSWER. Spread of the Corona virus 

## Basic SIR model

## SIR model with vaccination

![Conceptual scheme of the SIR model including vaccination.](images/conceptual_SIR_vaccin.png){width=10cm}

## SIR model with the "British variant"

![Conceptual scheme of the SIR model including a new variant.](images/conceptual_SIR_variant.png){width=9cm}

The assumptions are:

* Immunity is gained for all variants whatever variant a person was infected with. 
* Vaccination protects against all corona variants.


# Exercise 4 ANSWER.	Crops and weed

![Conceptual scheme of the crops and weed model.](images/conceptual_crops.png){width=85%}

* The approach 'fertilize once before planting' can be implemented by increasing the initial concentration of P in the upper layer.
* The approach 'fertilize regularly after planting' is implemented as a flux (called *Paddition* in the scheme).
