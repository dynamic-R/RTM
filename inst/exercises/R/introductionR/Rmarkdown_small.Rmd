## The airquality data set

The R dataset "airquality" contains daily air quality measurements in New York, from May to September 1973. In the code below, we first look at the first two rows of this dataset
and then plot the solar radiation and wind data, in two figures next to one another

```{r}
head(airquality, n = 2)  # show first two lines
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))     # figures aligned in one row, two columns
plot(airquality$Solar.R, type = "l", xlab = "time", ylab = "Solar.R")
plot(airquality$Wind,    type = "l", xlab = "time", ylab = "Wind"   )
```
